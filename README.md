# Nash Stablecoin

## Description

- The blockchain app consists of three kinds of tokens: Nash, Bond, Share.
  - Nash: The core token of the system, which is pegged directly to the US Dollar.
  - Bond: Non-fungible tokens which are resealed when the price is under the Pegg to contract the Nash supply. They are only purchasable by Nash tokens, and when the price goes     - upper than the Pegg, these tokens will be changed to Nash automatically. 
  - Share: There is a reserve of ‘LSK’ coins that can help us make the system more sustainable under complex economic conditions. Users can invest in the reserve in exchange for Share tokens. A part of generated Nash tokens in high prices are distributed among Shareholders.

- Current PoC version supports for:
  - Transfer LSK or Nash tokens
  - Trading Share tokens
  - Purchase unsold Bonds
  - Pricing the Nash and test the reaction of the system to price changes
